## I'm working on

* [A game engine project](https://github.com/SausageTaste/Dalbaragi), which uses Vulkan API to render.
* There is [another game engine project](https://github.com/SausageTaste/Little-Ruler), which uses OpenGL. It is kinda dead by now, but is the most profound thing I've ever made so far.
* [Blog](https://sausagetaste.github.io/)! The posts are written in Korean, btw.

## Languages

I'm a native **Korean** speaker.<br>
For **English**, reading and writing are ok but speaking and listening are not.
