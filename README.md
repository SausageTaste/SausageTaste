## I'm working on

A game engine!
It's a huge infrastructure with following repositories:
* Main engine project is [Mirinae](https://github.com/SausageTaste/mirinae)
* [Android Studio project](https://github.com/SausageTaste/Mirinae-Android) of it
* [Blender extension](https://github.com/SausageTaste/io_scene_dalbaragi) to export models to JSON
* [A tools](https://github.com/SausageTaste/dalbaragi) that parses JSON and produces *Dalbaragi Model Data (DMD)*, which is my own 3D file format

I have a [blog](https://sausagetaste.github.io/) as well!
It's in Korean, btw.
